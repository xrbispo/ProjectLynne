# ProjectLynne
<< HVManager - Hardware and Virtualization Manager >>

- Web application that controls all the daily tasks performed by the team in charge of hardware and virtualization of the datacenter
- Main objectives: 
    -> Automate the team routine as much as possible 
    -> Eliminate all manual tasks (almost anyway ;D ) 
    -> All tasks will be executed by scripts on different kinds of environments (vmware, hyper-v, rhev, cisco UCS, WDS, etc) 
    -> Single point entry for tasks (eliminate permission on several tools mentioned above) 
    -> Have a record of the tasks performed (user authenticated) 
    -> Maintain a central repository of hosts inventory 
    -> All data can be used to generate reports and indicators for managers
